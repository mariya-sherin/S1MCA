    <h2 class="about-heading" id="about">Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kaloor</h2>
    <p>The Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, also known as Kaloor Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Ernakulam Kochi, Kerala, India. Since the 2017 renovation, the stadium has a seating capacity of 80,234 . Previously, it used to have a capacity of 80,000 spectators, that was limited to 41,000 for Indian Super League matches due to various security reasons. It is the home ground of the Indian Super League Club Kerala Blasters FC. The stadium is widely touted to have hosted one of the loudest audiences for association football matches in the world.</p>
    <p>The Kaloor Stadium was originally constructed as a cricket stadium. But considering that Kerala is one of the few regions in India where football enjoys considerable popularity it was used for football matches also. Indeed, in a match between India and Iraq in 1997, approximately 1,00,000 spectators filled up the venue, thus overcrowding it, which remains a record at this place</p>
